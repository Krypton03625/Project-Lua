# Project-Lua
I’ve created a Full Library Management System in Python with the following features:

Book Management: Add new books, generate barcodes for them, and track donations.
Member Management: Add and view members.
Issue/Return System: Issue books to members and mark them as returned.
Transaction History: View a record of all transactions.
Database Support: Uses SQLite to store all records.
Barcode Generation: Generates barcodes for each book using its ISBN.




To add a modern UI to the library management system, I have used Tkinter (built into Python) or a more advanced option like PyQt or Kivy. I implemented the UI using Tkinter for simplicity, as it’s lightweight and requires no extra installations.

Here's a plan for the UI:

Dashboard: Buttons for managing books, members, and transactions.
Book Management: Add, view, and search for books.
Member Management: Add, view, and search for members.
Transactions: Issue and return books, and view transaction history.
